## Making Changes

1. **Write tests first**: Add tests for any new functionality or bug fixes
2. **Follow existing code style**: Match the patterns used in the codebase
3. **Keep commits focused**: Each commit should represent a single logical change
4. **Update documentation**: Update README.md or other docs if needed

## Testing Guidelines

- All new features must have tests
- Tests should cover both positive and negative cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Group related tests using `describe` blocks

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type annotations where TypeScript can't infer them

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass: `npm run test:run`
2. Update documentation if you've made API changes
3. Add a descriptive title and description to your PR
4. Link any related issues
